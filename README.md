# PicoW I2C scanner

A simple scanner to find all I2C device addresses connected to a Raspberry Pi PicoW. There are lots of examples for the pico, however the picow uses different SDA and SCL ports, 8 and 9 respecively.

It uses the Arduino libraries for simplicity, specifically Wire.h which can all be found at [github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi](https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi)

Enjoy!
